### Explanation
The `TonClient4` class is designed for interacting with a TON blockchain node. It utilizes the axios library for making HTTP requests to the blockchain node's API endpoint. The class provides various methods to fetch information about blocks, accounts, transactions, and execute smart contract methods.

The methods often involve making HTTP requests to the TON blockchain node, parsing the responses, and handling the data accordingly. The class also includes methods for working with smart contracts, such as opening contracts, creating providers, and executing contract methods.

The class uses a number of types and utility functions imported from external modules (`@ton/core`, `../utils/maybe`, `../utils/toUrlSafe`, `zod`). These modules likely contain additional utility functions and type definitions that are used in the implementation of the `TonClient4` class.

Note: The code provided is incomplete, and it seems to be part of a larger implementation. If you have any specific questions or if you'd like more information about a particular part of the code, feel free to ask.

Certainly! Let's go deeper into the remaining code:

### Contract Provider Methods

#### 1. `getState()`
   - This method retrieves the current state of the smart contract.
   - It first resolves the block, then fetches the account information using the `getAccount` method.
   - The retrieved account information is transformed into a format that includes balance, last transaction details, and storage state.
   - The transformed state is then returned.

#### 2. `get(name: string, args?: TupleItem[])`
   - Retrieves the result of a specific method (`name`) on the smart contract.
   - It first resolves the block (if not provided), then calls the `runMethod` method to execute the contract method.
   - Validates the exit code of the method execution, throwing an error if it indicates failure.
   - Returns the result of the method as a `TupleReader`, which can be used to read the output.

#### 3. `external(message: Buffer)`
   - Sends an external message to the smart contract.
   - Resolves the latest block information.
   - Checks if initialization data (`init`) is required and sends the external message using the `external` method from the `@ton/core` library.
   - The external message includes the destination address, initialization data if needed, and the message body.

#### 4. `internal(via: ContractProvider, message: InternalMessage)`
   - Sends an internal message to the smart contract via another contract (`via`).
   - Resolves the latest block information.
   - Checks if initialization data (`init`) is required.
   - Resolves parameters like value, bounce, send mode, and message body.
   - Sends the internal message using the `via.send` method, which typically involves invoking a method on another contract.

### Codecs for Data Validation

#### 1. `lastBlockCodec`
   - Validates the structure of the response containing information about the last block.
   - Checks for properties such as `seqno`, `shard`, `workchain`, `fileHash`, `rootHash`, and `stateRootHash`.

#### 2. `blockCodec`
   - Validates the structure of the response containing information about a block.
   - Supports both the case where the block does not exist (`exist: false`) and the case where it exists (`exist: true`).

#### 3. `storageStatCodec`
   - Validates the structure of storage statistics, including properties like `lastPaid`, `duePayment`, and `used` (with sub-properties).

#### 4. `accountCodec` and `accountLiteCodec`
   - Validate the structure of responses containing account information.
   - `accountCodec` provides detailed information including `state`, `balance`, `last` transaction details, and `storageStat`.
   - `accountLiteCodec` provides a lighter version with less detail.

#### 5. `changedCodec`
   - Validates the structure of the response indicating whether an account has changed.
   - Contains a boolean property `changed` and block information if changed.

#### 6. `runMethodCodec`
   - Validates the structure of the response after executing a contract method.
   - Includes properties such as `exitCode`, `resultRaw`, and details about the executed block and shard block.

#### 7. `configCodec`
   - Validates the structure of the response containing network configuration.
   - Checks for properties like `cell`, `address`, and `globalBalance`.

#### 8. `sendCodec`
   - Validates the structure of the response after sending an external message.
   - Contains a `status` property indicating the status of the message.

#### 9. `transactionsCodec` and `parsedTransactionsCodec`
   - Validate the structure of responses containing raw and parsed transaction data.
   - `transactionsCodec` includes an array of block information and a string-encoded `boc`.
   - `parsedTransactionsCodec` includes an array of parsed transactions and block information.
